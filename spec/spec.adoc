# Overview of the format

A FLIF file consists of 4 parts, with increasingly complicated encoding methods:

1. The main header, containing basic image metadata: width, height, color depth, number of frames. This information is encoded in a straightforward way, to make it easy to quickly identify a file.
2. Optional metadata chunks. These chunks contain non-pixel data: Exif/XMP metadata, an ICC color profile, ... This information is encoded using DEFLATE compression.
3. Second header, containing further information about how the actual pixel data is encoded. This header also describes a chain of transformations that were applied before encoding, which have to be reversed after decoding (e.g. the YCoCg color transform). This information is encoded using CABAC entropy coding.
4. The actual pixel data. This information is encoded using MANIAC entropy coding.

# Part 1: main header

|===
| Type             | Description                           | Value

| 4 bytes          | Magic                                 | `"FLIF"`
| 4 bits           | Interlacing, animation                | 3 = ni still; 4 = i still; 5 = ni anim; 6 = i anim
| 4 bits           | Number of channels (**nb_channels**)  | 1 = Grayscale; 3 = RGB; 4 = RGBA
| 1 byte           | Bytes per channel (**Bpc**)           | '0','1','2'   (`"0"`=custom)
| varint           | Width                                 | **width**-1
| varint           | Height                                | **height**-1
| varint           | Number of frames (**nb_frames**)      | **nb_frames**-2  (only if animation)
|===

The fifth byte is an ASCII character that can be interpreted as follows:
for non-interlaced still images: '1'=Grayscale, '3'=RGB, '4'=RGBA,
for interlaced images add +0x10 (so 'A'=Grayscale, 'C'=RGB, 'D'=RGBA),
for animations add +0x20 (so 'Q', 'S', 'T' for non-interlaced, 'a','c','d' for interlaced).

Variable-size integer encoding (varint):
  An unsigned integer (Big-Endian, MSB first) stored on a variable number of bytes.
  All the bytes except the last one have a '1' as their first bit.
  The unsigned integer is represented as the concatenation of the remaining 7 bit codewords.

**nb_frames** is 1 for a still image, > 1 for an animation.

# Part 2: metadata

Chunks are defined similar to PNG chunks, except the chunk size is encoded with a variable number of bytes, and there is no chunk CRC.
Also, the first chunk (which is always "FLIF") has no explicit chunk size.

Chunk names are either 4 letters (4 bytes), or 1 byte with a value below 32.

The convention of using upper and lower case letters is kept, but the meaning of the bits is slightly different.

- First letter: uppercase=critical, lowercase=non-critical -> non-critical chunks can be stripped while keeping a valid file (it might be rendered differently though)
- Second letter: uppercase=public, lowercase=private
- Third letter: uppercase=needed to correctly display the image (e.g. a color profile), lowercase=can be stripped safely without changing anything visually
- Fourth letter: uppercase=safe to copy blindly (when editing the actual image data), lowercase=may depend on image data (e.g. contain a thumbnail)

This optional part is a concatenation of chunks that each look like this:

|===
| Type             | Description

| 4 bytes          | Chunk name
| varint           | Chunk length (_size_)
| _size_ bytes     | DEFLATE-compressed chunk content
|===

# Part 3: second header

From here on, all values are encoded using arithmetic coding.

rac24(_min_,_max_) denotes an integer in the interval _min_.._max_ (inclusive), encoded using the UniformSymbolCoder and a 24-bit RAC. This encoding is not context-adaptive, and every number in the interval gets a fixed chance (close to a uniform distribution, hence the name).
rac24(_b_) denotes an integer of _b_ bits, i.e. it's a synonym for rac24(0,2^_b_-1).

rac24_CONTEXT(_min_,_max_) denotes an integer in the interval _min_.._max_ (inclusive), encoded using the SimpleSymbolCoder and a 24-bit RAC, where the chance table is given by CONTEXT. This encoding is context-adaptive; numbers are encoded using a zero-sign-exponent-mantissa representation, which favors distributions in which near-zero values have a higher chance.

Channels are ordered as follows:

|===
| Channel number | Description

| 0              | Red or Gray
| 1              | Green
| 2              | Blue
| 3              | Alpha
|===


## Transformations

|===
| Type             | Description

| rac24(1) = 1     | Indicator bit: not done yet
| rac24(0,13)      | Transformation identifier
| variable         | Transformation data (depends on transformation)
|===

Transformations have to be encoded in ascending order of transformation identifier. All transformations are optional.

Transformations serve two main purposes:

1. to modify the pixel data (in a reversible way) to make it compress better, and
2. to keep track of the range of actually occuring pixel values, in order to narrow it down.

Initially, pixel values are assumed to be in the range 0..2^(bit_depth); this range can be modified by transformations.
We'll use **range(_channel_).min** and **range(_channel_).max** to denote the global minimum and maximum value of a particular channel. We also use a potentially more accurate (narrow) conditional range **crange(_channel_,_values_)** to denote the range of a pixel value in channel **_channel_**, _given that the pixel values in previously encoded channels are_ **_values_**. Initially, the conditional ranges are simply equal to the global range, but transformations might change that.

As a typical example, consider 8-bit RGBA to which the YCoCg transformation gets applied:

|===
| Channel number | Original meaning | Original range | New meaning        | New range

| 0              | Red              | 0..255         | Luma (Y)           | 0..255
| 1              | Green            | 0..255         | Chroma orange (Co) | -255..255
| 2              | Blue             | 0..255         | Chroma green (Cg)  | -255..255
| 3              | Alpha            | 0..255         | Alpha              | 0..255
|===

In this example, the conditional ranges also change: e.g. **crange(1,2)** (the range for Co given that Y=2) happens to be -7..7.

# Part 4: pixel data

## Non-Interlaced method

If this encode method is used, then we start immediately with the encoding of the MANIAC trees (see below), followed by the encoding of the pixels. The order in which the pixels are encoded is described by the following nested loops:

* For all channels: (in the order 4,3,0,1,2, skipping those that don't exist or have a singleton range)
** For all rows: (from 0 to **height**-1) :
*** For all frames: (from 0 to **nb_frames**-1) :
**** For all columns: (from 0 to **width**-1, or in case FrameShape is used, from begin[row] to end[row])
***** Encode a pixel

## Interlaced method

For interlacing, we define the notion of _zoomlevels_. Zoomlevel 0 is the full image. Zoomlevel 1 are all the even-numbered rows of the image (counting from 0). Zoomlevel 2 are all the even-numbered columns of zoomlevel 1. In general: zoomlevel _2k+1_ are all the even-numbered rows of zoomlevel _2k_, and zoomlevel _2k+2_ are all the even-numbered columns of zoomlevel _2k+1_.

In other words, every even-numbered zoomlevel _2k_ is a downsampled version of the image, at scale 1:__2^k__.

We defined the 'maximum zoomlevel' **max_zl** of an image as the zoomlevel with the lowest number that consists of a single pixel. This is always the pixel in the top-left corner of the image (row 0, column 0). This pixel is always encoded first.

The zoomlevels are encoded from highest (most zoomed out) to lowest; in each zoomlevel, obviously only those pixels are encoded that haven't been encoded previously. So in an even-numbered zoomlevel, the odd-numbered rows are encoded, while in an odd-numbered zoomlevel, the odd-numbered columns are encoded.

If the interlaced encode method is used, we do not encode the MANIAC trees right away. Instead, we initialize the trees to a single root node per channel, and start encoding a 'rough preview' of the image (a few of the highest zoomlevels).
This allows a rough thumbnail extraction without needing to decode the MANIAC tree.
Then the MANIAC tree is encoded, and then the rest of the zoomlevels are encoded.


|===
| Type                                         | Description

| rac24(0..**max_zl**)                         | Number of the first MANIAC-encoded zoomlevel: **first_zl**
| Encode_zoomlevels(**max_zl**,**first_zl**+1) | encoding of zoomlevels **max_zl** until **first_zl**+1
| encoding of MANIAC trees                     | see further below
| Encode_zoomlevels(**first_zl**,0)            | encoding of zoomlevels **first_zl** until 0
|===

The encoding of a series of zoomlevels happens by interleaving the channels in some way. This interleaving is either in the 'default order', or in a custom order. In any case, the following invariants must hold:

* Zoomlevel _k_ of a channel can only be encoded after zoomlevel _k+1_ of that channel has already been encoded;
* If channel 3 exists and **alpha_zero** is true, then zoomlevel _k_ of channel 0 (usually Luma) can only be encoded after zoomlevel _k_ of channel 3 (Alpha) has already been encoded;
* Zoomlevel _k_ of channel 1 (usually Co) can only be encoded after zoomlevel _k_ of channel 0 (usually Luma) has been encoded;
* Zoomlevel _k_ of channel 2 (usually Cg) can only be encoded after zoomlevel _k_ of channels 0 and 1 (Luma and Co) have been encoded;
* If channel 4 (FrameLookback) exists: zoomlevel _k_ of any other channel (0,1,2, or 3) can only be encoded after zoomlevel _k_ of channel 4 has already been encoded.

### Actual pixel encoding


## MANIAC tree encoding
There is one tree per non-trivial channel (a channel is trivial if its range is a singleton or if it doesn't exist).
The trees are encoded independently and in a recursive (depth-first) way, as follows:

**nb_properties** depends on the channel, the number of channels, and the encoding method (interlaced or non-interlaced).

|===
| Type | Description | Condition

| rac24_A(0,**nb_properties**)
| 0=leaf node, > 0: _property_+1

| rac24_B(1,512)
| node counter
| not a leaf node

| rac24_C(range[_property_].min,range[_property_].max-1)
| _test_value_
| not a leaf node

| recursive encoding of left branch
| where range[_property_].min = _test_value_+1
| not a leaf node

| recursive encoding of right branch
| where range[_property_].max = _test_value_
| not a leaf node
